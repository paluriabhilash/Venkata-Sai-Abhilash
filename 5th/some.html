  <h1>FZ V3 Bikes</h1>
  <a href="https://www.bikewale.com/yamaha-bikes/fz/">Ride it</a>
  <P>BikeWale's Take:
    The Yamaha FZ V3 is more muscular in terms of design as compared to the earlier variant. 
    The bike offers a comfortable riding position along with modern features thatput it on par with its rivals.
    It comes with a 149cc engine that offers decent fuel-efficiency.
    However, it has a limited-service reach and demands a price higher than its rivals
    Yamaha FZ FI Expert Opinion:
    It all started with the FZ-16 that was introduced in India back in 2008. 
    It was the bike all the young guns wanted. Fast forward to 2019 and here 
    you have the FZ-S V3 which, as the insightful lot of you might have guessed right,
    is the third generation of the FZ-16.</P>
